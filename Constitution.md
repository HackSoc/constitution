# HackSoc Constitution

The purpose of this Constitution is to lay out the duties, responsibilities and guidance which members are expected to abide by and to provide the University of York University Students' Union (YUSU) with details about the Society.

This Constitution does not follow the default template laid out by YUSU, but does closely follow the content of the YUSU template, with deviations as allowed. This document is formatted in a way which leads to easier and more transparent change tracking than is allowed by the format of the YUSU constitution template.

6. If the no confidence motion is unsuccessful:
    1. YUSU will facilitate support with the Committee to resolve any outstanding issues.
    2. Further 'no confidence' motions must be on different grounds and not within one calendar month of the general meeting at which the last 'no confidence' motion against that Committee member was heard.

2. Any matter which may be considered grounds for suspension or exclusion must be referred as a matter of urgency to YUSU who will instigate the process for an investigation.
3. If an imminent risk is identified a Society member may be suspended immediately for a period of up to 14 days.
    1. Any assessment of risk must be carried out by YUSU at the earliest opportunity.

    1. The panel for the hearing will be chaired by the Student Activities Officer (or the York Sport President if there is a conflict of interest) with the following additional members: a member of Societies Committee (who is not a member of any other Society in the same category as the Society) and a member of the York Sport Committee, neither of whom should have previous knowledge of the nature of the allegations, and a YUSU Staff member who will minute the meeting.
    2. Any decision to exclude a member requires a majority vote from the panel and must be communicated in writing, with a statement of reasons, to the excluded member within 7 days.
6. A member may appeal against any decision to suspend or exclude them on the grounds of lack of adherence to process, provision of further evidence or evidence that the decision was biased or prejudiced. The member must communicate their intention to appeal in writing to YUSU.
7. Any appeal of a decision to suspend or exclude a member must be heard by a panel who were not involved with the original decision, have no prior knowledge of the case and will be chaired by a Full Time Officer. Ideally this panel will also consist of one more member each from Societies Committee and the York Sport Committee. However the panel will primarily be constituted with a view to fairness and elimination of conflict of interest.
8. An appeals panel only has the power to uphold or overturn a decision by the initial panel. They may not suggest alternative sanctions.
