# The HackSoc Constitution

The 'master' branch of this repository holds the canonical version of the HackSoc constitution and its appendices.

The constitution is available in [Constitution.md](./Constitution.md) and appendices may be found in [appendices/](./appendices/).

A PDF copy of the constitution and declaration can be produced by running `make` (pdflatex and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) are required). `Roles.md` should be created by copying `Roles.template.md`, filling in the names and removing the instructions, but should not be committed.

This document outlines the procedure for changes to the constitution held in this repository. While it is not binding, it MUST be followed for consistency and continuity.
