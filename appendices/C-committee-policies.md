# Appendix C: Committee Policies

This appendix lays out additional policies which the Committee should follow. It may be amended separately from the rest of the Constitution by a majority vote of the Committee.

## 1. Changes of Name

1. When a HackSoc member changes their name, the Committee should update all records containing the old name without delay. This includes, where applicable, email addresses and usernames (subject to section C.1.4).
2. If the member owns a HackSoc hoodie or other merchandise which shows their old name, the Committee should offer to provide a replacement, free of charge, at the next available opportunity.
3. If the member holds a Committee position, the Committee should offer to update previous meeting minutes to reflect their new name.
4. At all times, the member's wishes regarding their name must be respected (for example, a member may want or need to be known by different names within HackSoc and in public).
