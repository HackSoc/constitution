# Appendix D: Code of Conduct

This appendix lays out the code of conduct that all HackSoc members must adhere by. This code of conduct can also be found on the HackSoc [website](https://www.hacksoc.org/coc.html), which also details some conventions used in HackSoc spaces.

## Values Statement

HackSoc aims to be an inclusive space for all, and this code of conduct aims to reflect that. We are not able to cover every single behaviour in this code of conduct, so do not take it as a bullet pointed list of what you can and cannot do. Please follow the spirit of this code as well as the letter.

If you see behaviour that is unacceptable and the person committing it doesn’t stop when asked, please reach out to a committee member, either in a channel or privately. (Your confidentiality will be respected if you reach out privately.)

We will not tolerate any use of this code of conduct as a hammer against marginalised people speaking out against harassment or microaggressions, or enforcing reasonable boundaries.

## Rules

### General

* No sexism, racism, ableism, queerphobia, xenophobia, casteism, antisemitism or discrimination of any kind
* No advocating, even in jest, for Nazis/white supremacy etc
* Be wary of “dog whistles”, or innocuous-seeming words or images that have another meaning to a specific audience (the [Anti-Defamation League](https://www.adl.org/hate-symbols) has a list of (mainly white supremacist) hate symbols which may be used as dog whistles)
* Avoid making fun of other people’s spelling, word choices, phrasing etc. – if you’re making a joke, think for a few seconds about why it’s funny first
* Please don't enter HackSoc social spaces in order to advertise
* Committee may ask you to stop any behaviour that is not explicitly disallowed here
* No bullying or harrassment. If someone asks you to stop interacting with them, do not use our spaces to circumvent this.
* No threatening language or behaviour. Do not say or do anything that could reasonably cause someone to fear for their safety.
* No doxxing or threatening to dox someone. It can be just as frightening to claim that you know where someone lives as it is to outright post their address.
* This Code of Conduct applies to all HackSoc spaces, online or physical, public or private
* As a YUSU society, our members are also bound by the [YUSU Code of Conduct](https://yusu.org/about-us/documents/by-laws)

### Chat Platforms

* No spam
    * e.g. using excessive numbers of animated emoji
* Bots are welcome, so long as they don’t produce spam
* Follow the content requirements of those who host us
* You may be asked to stop a conversation by committee
* Committee reserve the right to remove messages if they are in violation of the codes of conduct and you have been asked to stop by a committee member
* Committee reserve the right to kick humans or bots at any time
* Committee reserve the right to delete channels
* Committee reserves the right to delete any content
    * e.g. NSFW content

* Not everyone is at the same level. Do not mock, humiliate, or insult someone over the contents of a pull request.
* Issues, pull requests, and the contents of files pushed to HackSoc repositories are all covered by this Code of Conduct
